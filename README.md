# 🧪 Penicillin Batch Yield — Real-Time ML Monitoring & Prediction System

## A production-style MLOps project that predicts penicillin concentration during batch runs and monitors model/data drift in real time.

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **production-like MLOps workflow** using a realistic bioprocess scenario: predicting **penicillin concentration** during a batch fermentation run and continuously monitoring model performance and drift.

The system combines:
- A **containerized inference API** (Cloud Run)
- A **Dash web application** for interactive analysis (Cloud Run)
- **Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards** for operational monitoring
- **Automated drift reporting** (Evidently) published to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

The result is a deployable web application that a non-technical user can open in a browser, run inference by batch number, and review the system’s health and drift signals.

## Business Problem Solved

**Challenge:** Batch bioprocesses are expensive and time-sensitive. Operators need to make decisions during the run, such as:
- When the process is approaching key concentration thresholds
- Whether incoming sensor patterns look “unusual” compared to normal operation, as these influence the resulting batch yield
- Whether model accuracy or data quality is degrading over time
- The company needs to ensure stable batch and optimum batch yields by stopping the batch run at the maximum possible pennicilin concentration in the bioreactor
- What process parameters can be key indicators of a below optimum batch yield?

**Solution:** A real-time ML system that:
- predicts the concentration curve for a selected batch 3 time units in advance (36 minutes). Previously, the actual concentration or potential yield was only known every      12 minutes.
- surfaces an interpretable prediction visualization in a UI
- logs monitoring signals and drift metrics automatically
- produces drift reports for auditing and investigations
- detects drift in realtime to enable continous model retraining, or allow model retraining strategies to be implemented when a certain drift threshold for X number of features is reached. The type of drift detection and feature specific thresholds can be manually specified
- Bioreactor usage can be optimized, as batch runs can be terminated earlier once a specified yield concentration has been reached, allowing for a next batch run to be started. This also reduces the amount of raw materials and energy costs being needed per batch run

## ✅ Key Features

### 🔮 Real-Time Inference API (Cloud Run)
- `/run-inference` accepts a `batch_number` and returns:
  - prediction array for the batch
  - RMSE score (latest observed)
  - drift metrics (share of drifted features, per-feature drift scores)
  - drift report URI (HTML stored in GCS)
- `/metrics` exposes Prometheus metrics
- `/health` basic health check
- `/latest_monitoring_metrics` to read last computed metrics **without re-running inference**

### 📈 Web Application (Dash)
- **Predictions page**:
  - selects a batch number
  - triggers inference
  - plots predicted concentration curve and KPI summaries
- **Monitoring page**:
  - embeds Grafana dashboards (served through grafana service deployed separately)
  - shows quick “status badges” (RMSE, drift share, feature drift)
- **Drift report page**:
  - loads latest Evidently report from Cloud Storage Bucket

### 📊 Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Prometheus scrapes inference API metrics
- Grafana dashboards visualize:
  - RMSE trend
  - drift share
  - feature drift scores
  - request rate & latency

### ☁️ Cloud Storage (GCS)
- Stores:
  - raw and processed data (parquet)
  - predictions and root mean squared error scores with timestamps (parquet)
  - drift reports (`latest.html`, `latest.json`)

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

![Architecture](images/arch_diagram.png)

### Data & Control Flow (high-level)
1. User selects a batch in the web app and triggers inference  
2. Web app calls **Inference API** (Cloud Run)  
3. Inference API loads/refreshes feature data, returns predictions from inference pipeline and stores predictions and model metrics in GCS  
4. API computes drift signals + generates an Evidently report  
5. Predictions + drift reports are uploaded to **GCS**  
6. Prometheus scrapes `/metrics` and Grafana visualizes monitoring dashboards  
7. Web app embeds dashboards + loads latest drift report from GCS
